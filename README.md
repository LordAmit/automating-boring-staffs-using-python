# automating-boring-tasks-using-python
Will be sharing the boring problems I solved/automated using python. Why? Cause bragging.
Just to note, the programs are written using `python3.6`.

Dependencies:
- sometimes click from pip is required. Not all packages may need it. To install, simply use:
    ```python3.6 -m pip install click```
