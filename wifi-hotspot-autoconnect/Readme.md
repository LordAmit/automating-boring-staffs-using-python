# Wifi Hotspot Autoconnect

Problem:
Hotspot gets turned off when laptop goes to sleep. I have to click here and there to have it start again. On the other hand, if I set it to autoconnect via GUI, it will always turn on hotspot by default even when I do not want to.

Hence, this script. Allows me to programmatically turn on / turn off auto connect at ease without clicking around for... 10 seconds. Yay.

Seriously, I did this because:

-  I was bored
-  To learn python CLI framework, `click` seemed like a good choice
-  To start practising test driven development
-  To figure out how to handle the pesky project structure of python in a good way. Those `PYTHONPATH` AND `__init__.py` always gets auto-erased from memory without practise.

So yeah, a completely random project. Worth it? Yup.
